# UniFriend

## About
UniFriend is my A-level computer science project that I will be completing for my grade. It's a website that is designed in order to allow university students to meet with other students from their university or other universities around the UK. Until the succes is measured within the UK and the project is complete it will remain UK only.

## Pull requests and contributions
As this is my A-level computer science project, all the coding work must be completed by myself only <br>
However, if you feel there is anything I changed please open an issue and we can discuss any changes.
